A model with the 2017-state-of-art Gated Recurrent Averaging Network 
(GRAN) architecture that achieves a high prediction accuracy on the 
Quera Question Pairs competition task.

The architecture uses LSTM, averaging and a gating system to produce 
sentence embeddings, adaptable word embedding matrix preinitialized 
with 300D GloVe.

The key idea behind the GRAN is to add importance to different word 
embeddings prior to averaging. The gate can be seen as an attention, 
attending to the information of each step of the LSTM such that:

    a = x * sigmoid(W_x * x + W_h * h + b)

This model was inspired by John Weithing, a PhD student at the Toyota 
Technological Institute at the University of Chicago. Details of this 
model can be found at http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~wieting/wieting2017Recurrent.pdf
