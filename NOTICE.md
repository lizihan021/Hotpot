   This work was originaly forked from **dataset-sts**, thanks to them! We 
   updated their code to use Keras 2.0 and added some state-of-the-art models. 
   Here is their license and attribution claim:  
   
   Always check the licences of the respective datasets you are using!  Some of
   them are plain CC-BY, others may be heavily restricted e.g. for non-commercial
   use only.  Default licence for anything else in this repository is ASLv2 for
   the code, CC-BY 4.0 for data.

   Work on this project has been in part kindly sponsored by the Medialab
   foundation (http://medialab.cz/), a Czech Technical University incubator.
